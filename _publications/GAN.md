excerpt: 'Abstractâ€”In recent years, the rapid expansion of Unmanned
 Aerial Vehicle (UAV) networks has unveiled new security vul
nerabilities, making intrusion detection in these networks a top
 priority. Despite the demonstrated success of various machine
 learning algorithms in network intrusion detection, these methods
 often falter under adversarial conditions or when confronted
 with advanced attack strategies. Further complicating matters,
 real-world UAV data streams are relentless, vast, and storage
intensive, rendering the storage of all data nearly impossible.
 Moreover, a notable gap in the research is the absence of
 universally recognized datasets specifically tailored for UAV
 network intrusion detection. Considering the above points, this
 paper presents an innovative approach for real-time intrusion
 detection. This method employs Generative Adversarial Networks
 (GANs) to produce synthetic intrusion detection data. Following
 this, a stream-based active learning mechanism is applied for
 instantaneous monitoring and action. The hallmark of our
 approach lies in the novel integration of stream-based modeling
 with GANs. Our proposed system leverages active learning,
 working seamlessly alongside domain experts to adapt to ever
changing data scenarios, ensuring superior detection accuracy
 while substantially reducing false positive rates. When bench
marked against conventional intrusion detection paradigms, our
 approach demonstrates a marked improvement in detection pre
cision. Future research endeavors will delve into further refining
 this method, embedding it into prevailing security frameworks,
 and examining its potential application to other complex network
 spheres.'
