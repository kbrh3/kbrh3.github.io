excerpt: 'Generative AI, specifically large multimode models (LMM), is transforming the practice of 
machine learning or conventional AI for applying predictive analytics in engineering and many 
other fields. In Civil Engineering, one traditionally hard problem, image-based built-environment 
understanding, has become surprisingly easy. In our testing, using an LMM engine, one can 
readily obtain semantics-rich outputs, including pixel-level parsing and descriptive captions. The 
underlying learning is realized through a hybrid set of generative supervised deep learning and 
zero-shot learning (ZSL) models. However, it is recognized that, due to the underlying 
complexity of mixed learning models in an LMM architecture, no confidence or posterior
probability scores are generated, which hinders the design of a human-in-the-loop (HITL) 
decision-making process. In our case, we focus on applying LMM for disaster-scene 
understanding to achieve rapid post-disaster recovery. We argue that in such a process, humans 
should not wait for the output from a GAI-driven workflow as ‘end-users’; instead, they should 
collaboratively participate in different phases, including crowd-based data collection, cleaning, 
report generation, and mapping product creation. To realize this process, generating confidence 
scores from GAI models is crucial as it provides the mechanism for deciding whether a human 
intervention is necessary when a low GAI score is encountered. Using a data-centric approach 
and an open-source LMM framework, we manually grade GAI outputs as the ground-truth 
confidence scores given a curated disaster-scene database. We further develop a predictive 
model to generate the GAI confidence score relating to a set of intermediate measurements 
from the LMM model. We will demonstrate that such GAI confidence scores are instrumental in 
developing a HITL decision-making workflow for rapid and objective disaster-scene-enabled 
post-disaster response.'
