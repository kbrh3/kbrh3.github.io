excerpt: 'To achieve a climate-resilient nation, it is crucial to communicate climate risk comprehensively. The 
advent of generative AI (GAI) brings a significant opportunity to broaden climate risk-informed 
communication, and one potential is to use both climate forecast information and data from past climate 
events (e.g., disasters) to produce tailored climate risk content. This talk will explore the feasibility of 
GAI tools (GPT4, Gemini, etc.) to generate disaster content based on climate forecast information (e.g., 
expected more frequent extreme storms). We will demonstrate two-way generations with a focus on 
severe tornadoes. First, we revealed that GAI tools can provide accurate descriptions for input images 
with tornado disaster scenes from past tornado events, showing a human-like understanding of complex 
disaster scenes. With such performance, we argue that the communities can benefit from using GAI to 
accelerate post-disaster response or to enhance pre-disaster preparation. Second, at various EF scales 
based on user requests, GAI tools show significant randomness in generating visual damage patterns. In 
many cases, the results display the pareidolia effect, i.e., hallucinated rendering of tornado disaster scenes, 
implying its limitations in zero-shot learning capabilities in a textual-to-visual generation. '
