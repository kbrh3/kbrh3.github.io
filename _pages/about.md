üìñI'm a Computer Science student at the university of Missouri-Kansas City, working on the Bachelors to Masters degree.

üíæMy interests are cybersecurity, Artificial Intelligence, and Quantum Computing.

ü©∞I'm a dancer, and my favorite styles are Ballet and Contemporary.

üé™I love circus, and have been training Aerial Arts, Contortion, and Juggling for a few years now, with several different KC based Cirque Companies.

üêà‚Äç‚¨õI love books, crafting, and my two cats

Bio:
======
I am currently about 1-2 years away from graduating from my masters, and then I will most likely be seeking a PhD program. My long term goal is London, so a University in the UK would be ideal. I also wish to attend the national centre for circus arts while I am there; I have friends that attended and it comes highly recommended. Academically, I would like to do something related to AI, and work in research. I would not be apposed to trying other fields though, and do still love the puzzle that software development offers.

Projects
------
Currently working on several papers that will hopefully be published this summer. Both have short descriptions in the 'publications' tab. We are also working on using LLMs to create a RAG model to assist in reducing overdoses on drugs. The model will be trained on scientific papers given to us by the university's medical school, and will offer advice and warnings on things like how certain drugs mix, signs of overdosing, and what to do in an emergency. This will be completely anonymous, and though it is not a replacement for medical intervention it may reduce the necessity of such.
